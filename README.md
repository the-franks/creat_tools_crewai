## Overview

This project focuses on the application of various tools in the context of a customer outreach campaign. The notebook included in this project (`L4_tools_customer_outreach.ipynb`) provides a comprehensive guide on how to leverage the following key aspects of these tools:

- **Versatility**: Adaptability of tools to different tasks and requirements.
- **Fault Tolerance**: How to ensure systems remain operational despite failures.
- **Caching**: Techniques to store data temporarily to improve performance.

## Installation

The required libraries are already installed in the classroom environment. If you are running this notebook on your own machine, you can install the necessary dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install crewai==0.28.8 crewai_tools==0.1.6 langchain_community==0.0.29
```

## Environment Variables
